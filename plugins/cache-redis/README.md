## Purpose

This plugin adds the required code to use Redis as a cache in the service generated by Amplication.

It updates the following parts:

- Adds the required dependencies to `package.json`.
- Adds the required environment variables to `.env`.
- Adds the `CacheModule` configured to use Redis to the `app.module.ts` module imports list.
- Adds the required service to the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Configuration

The `host` setting is the host of the Redis server.

The `port` setting is the port on which the Redis server is accepting connections.

The `ttl` setting is the Time To Live for cached values.

The `max` setting is the maximum amount of requests that can be cached at once.

The `username` setting is the username used to connect to the server.

The `password` setting is the password used to connect to the server.

If no configuration is provided the .amplicationrc.json file will use be used as the default values.

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 6379,
  "ttl": 5000,
  "username": null,
  "password": null
}
```
